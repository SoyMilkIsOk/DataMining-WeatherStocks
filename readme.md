*Project Title*: ***NYC Weather and Trading Behavior***

*Team Members*: Connor Tree, Tara Panzarino, Sam Steingard

*Description*: This project aimed to quantify the effect that weather has on the stock market.

*Results Summary*:

- Does inclement weather in NYC have an effect on stock trading activity?
  - Precipitation has no correlation to daily stock % change
  - Temperature negatively correlated to daily trade volume
  - No significant conclusions       
- How do seasonal weather patterns affect stock trading behavior?
  - Precipitation positively correlates to volume
  - Temperature again negatively correlated to volume
  - Seasonal weather patterns can affect volume but not stock price


*Applications*:

- Analyzing possible relationships and correlations further could prove beneficial for the next iteration of quantitative trading algorithms. Being able to predict stock behavior is crucial in building a robust predictive model that can accurately predict stock prices and trends.
- This model would be helpful for companies/brokerage firms trying to understand the near and long term effects of weather patterns and events.
- This algorithm could be potentially useful for farmers as well if it were adapted to track with the price of nutrients, water, etc.. These are all goods that fluctuate in price and change depending on environmental conditions like weather or weather events.
- A future version of the model we developed could potentially even track global weather patterns to increase the scope of the results and provide users with predictive price information built upon world-wide data.
